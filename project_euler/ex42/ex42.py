    Coded triangle numbers

    

    The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
    >>> [get_nth_term(t) for t in range(1, 11)]
    [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55]

    By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value
is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
    >>> calc_word('SKY')
    55

    Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text
file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are
triangle words?
